# SpriteSheetAnimation
a python pyqt program to easily show and edit the sprite sheet animation, and save it as gif

as I'm new in python, I'm not sure if just uploading all files in my pycharm project would have a bad effect.

# TODO

when splitting another sheet while playing the animation, the program will fail

saving as gif does not work

more friendly prompts

better code refactoring

a README demonstration on how to use

...




PS

as I'm not familiar with git, I used gitkraken or pycharm and this made the commit owners not me
